## 🔍 Key Insights
🇺🇸 USA leads in customer activity, having the highest number of invoices, indicating it as the strongest market for the music store.

🌆 Prague and Paris generate the highest total invoice amounts, making them the top-performing cities in terms of revenue.

🧑‍💼 The senior-most employee has been identified, which is useful for understanding the company’s organizational structure.

💸 The top 3 customers contribute significantly to overall revenue, suggesting the value of customer segmentation and loyalty programs.

🎸 Rock is the most popular genre by purchase count, making it a key focus for future product offerings and promotions.

🎵 The top 10 tracks account for the majority of revenue, helping in identifying high-performing content.

🎨 Customers show distinct preferences for specific artists, and spending patterns per artist can inform personalized marketing.
