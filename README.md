## üîç Key Insights
üá∫üá∏ USA leads in customer activity, having the highest number of invoices, indicating it as the strongest market for the music store.

üåÜ Prague and Paris generate the highest total invoice amounts, making them the top-performing cities in terms of revenue.

üßë‚Äçüíº The senior-most employee has been identified, which is useful for understanding the company‚Äôs organizational structure.

üí∏ The top 3 customers contribute significantly to overall revenue, suggesting the value of customer segmentation and loyalty programs.

üé∏ Rock is the most popular genre by purchase count, making it a key focus for future product offerings and promotions.

üéµ The top 10 tracks account for the majority of revenue, helping in identifying high-performing content.

üé® Customers show distinct preferences for specific artists, and spending patterns per artist can inform personalized marketing.

üìä Sales distribution by genre and invoice totals by country provide useful visual insights for strategic regional planning.

üí∞ Artist revenue is unevenly distributed, pointing toward a small set of artists driving most of the sales..
